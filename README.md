# Alt-Ego

Alt Ego is a WordPress plugin that leverages OpenAI to automatically generate alt text, captions, and meta descriptions for your media uploads and posts.

## Features

- Generates alt text for images using the GPT-4 vision model
- Stores an API key in the WordPress settings
- Queues images when they are uploaded so generation can run in the background

To install, copy the `alt-ego` directory to your `wp-content/plugins` folder and activate the plugin from the WordPress admin. Enter your OpenAI API key under **Settings â†’ Alt Ego**.
